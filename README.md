Hello. In this project, I created a Telegram bot to control a computer. 
The bot is built on the Aiogramm library and uses a large number of libraries. 
To use it, you first need to create a file named .env in the directory where you will store your personal Telegram ID and Bot Token. 
For security reasons, I suggest saving this file separately.
Then, there is information on how to set up the variables. 
For example: id="Your Telegram ID (without quotes)", Api_Token="Unique Token from your Telegram bot (in quotes)". 
There is also information about the computer: kompfirst="Information about the computer in quotes." 
If you do not need this information, you can simply delete it or rewrite the code in the Handlers.py file from the get_proc function.
